## Background story
The world is fighting a scary virus that caused a lot of death. To save the world, three brave Disney princesses formed a squad to get the antidote in a castle guarded by a ferocious enemy. On the adventurous way to the castle, they have to fight different enemies and overcome many obstacles; but they work unitedly as a team using the different abilities that they have, and finally reach the destination and beat the dragon. 

## How it works
In the game, players can play the roles of three Disney princesses: Mulan, Elsa, and Jasmine. Each princess has her own actions: Mulan can attack the enemies with the sword, Elsa can freeze the enemies with her magic, and Jasmine can fly over the obstacles with her magic carpet. All of the princesses can walk, run and jump, and shoot balls to enemies. Players can switch characters at any point, they have to strategically decide which princess to choose given the different challenges that they encounter. The worlds are full of enemies and platforms, and obstacles. The players have three lives, they can collect lives along the way as makeups for the lost ones, they will lose the game if they lose all of their lives. They have to kill the boss and reach the castle to win the game.
